# cadenway-ops documentation

Planned role: cadenway-ops is the whole operation of Cadenway: what exists at OVH (Terraform), how the VPS is prepared (Ansible), and what runs in each environment (Docker Compose files, service definitions, versions and encrypted secrets read by the GitOps agent). It is also where local development starts the stack.

## Current status

At the time this documentation was written, this checkout has no Terraform, Ansible, Compose, GitOps agent, application manifest, or GitHub workflow files. The operational topology and commands in this guide are planned, not an active stack.

## Read the guides

- [Architecture and ownership](architecture.md): boundaries and planned repository structure.
- [Development and checks](development.md): prerequisites, planned commands and verification.
- [Domain and integration](integration.md): repository-specific contracts, behavior and dependencies.

## Sources and policy

- [Repository overview](../.github/README.md) and [contribution guide](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [Repository instructions and hard limits](../AGENTS.md).
- [Claude Code instructions](../CLAUDE.md) and [tooling](../.claude/README.md).
- [Codex tooling](../.codex/README.md).
- [Interactive mockup](https://claude.ai/artifact/KYRM7AnsYLiBLBLKy8i4HE), [integration guide](https://claude.ai/artifact/CpJHVCiFfF9j3KbHQ2S1Et), and [repositories and packages](https://claude.ai/artifact/BPinmYxoF3mbK8w9BMB43N).

Repository instructions take precedence over this summary. Refer to the actual package manifests, implementation, specifications, and workflows once they exist; do not infer a deployed feature from a target design.
